# Scaling Capital & Infra

- Start with $1k seed and strict caps; compound monthly if drawdown < 5%.
- Horizontal scaling: spin up strategy shards by instrument/regime.
- Meta-allocation monitors Sharpe decay and halves allocation on decay > 50%.
- Prefer netting engines to reduce fees; leverage maker rebates where safe.
